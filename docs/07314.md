# TwoBitCircus:建立互动娱乐的行业

> 原文:[https://hack aday . com/2014/10/14/twobitcircus-the-business-of-building-interactive-entertainment/](https://hackaday.com/2014/10/14/twobitcircus-the-business-of-building-interactive-entertainment/)

Hackaday 10th 周年纪念非常有趣，让它变得令人敬畏的部分原因是社区为活动带来的所有很酷的东西。在此之前，我们还没有机会见到 TwoBitCircus 的人，但是他们非常乐意带着他们出色的六重机器。这是一款 6 人定制的街机游戏，绝对震撼！

派对结束后，TwoBitCircus 的无畏领袖[Brent Bushnell]和[Eric Gradman]邀请我们去他们的空间快速参观他们的工作室，并亲自邀请我们参加即将到来的[STEAM 嘉年华](http://steamcarnival.com/)的黑客预览日。不，这不是蒸汽朋克中的蒸汽，而是科学技术工程艺术和数学中的蒸汽。

[![TwoBitCircus Workshop](../Images/53652c4ea63721424b0c9f132508af75.png)T2】](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_1973.jpg)

他们的空间真的很棒，是洛杉矶唐顿附近酿酒艺术区的一部分。这座建筑实际上是一座古老的蒸汽发电厂，天花板高得令人难以置信。TwoBitCircus 的工作人员现在大约有 30 人，他们都在为活动制作互动游戏和艺术品。他们称自己为数字马戏团，他们的许多作品都回归了昔日的嘉年华游戏，并加入了新的数字元素。

[Eric]和[Brent]花了几分钟时间让我们快速浏览一下 STEAM 嘉年华会有什么样的游戏。将会有各种各样的娱乐:由跷跷板控制的巨型大理石游戏，在巨大发光按钮墙上的打地鼠/龙卷风混搭游戏，基于激光的足球，以及更极端的献祭扣篮坦克！这将是一次极具娱乐性和教育性的活动。主要的公众日是在 10 月 25 日到 26 日的周末，但是在 10 月 23 日星期四有一个只邀请本地社区的[黑客预览](http://steamcarnival.com/event/hacker-preview-day/)，我们将会参加。如果你想去参加[主赛事](http://steamcarnival.com/event/steam-carnival-los-angeles/)，使用 code HACKADAY 比[25 美元](http://wl.flavorus.com/event/SC-Event/260436?afflky=TwoBitCircus)的票价优惠 5 美元。

对我这个东西的制造者来说，TwoBitCircus 最有意思的是这些家伙是如何把他们的爱好变成一个繁荣的活动生意的。Brent 告诉我们，他们从事这项工作已经 8 年了，而该公司已经成立 3 年了。他们也做得很好，为周围一些最大的公司做出了不可思议的事情。对于任何有创造力的黑客来说，这真的是最好的工作了，整天构建疯狂的东西给人们玩！我怀着无比羡慕的心情离开了这个地方。

看看下面的照片，感受一下你可能在狂欢节上看到的那种疯狂！
